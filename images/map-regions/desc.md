### Description â€“ Map Region Images

This folder stores images for the different map regions. Each of these is a 128x72 pixel art drawing.
Each image is stored alongside a copy of itself, whereby exits and obstacles are highlighted in red and green, respectively.

Regions that cannot be accessed by the player are blocked by using red pixels. If the player attempts to enter a red tile, it will not allow them.
Exits leading to other regions can be accessed by walking passed a range of green pixels on an edge.
